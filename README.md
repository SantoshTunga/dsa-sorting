## Bubble Sort 

Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order .The average and worst-case complexity of Bubble sort is O(n2), where n is a number of items.

The outer loop ensure for comparing all the elements and control the length of the array for the each iteration
The inner loop compare all the elements ,swap them as required
and ensure the biggest / smallest element at the end .
